# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ramosp1

Iâ€™m Pedro Ramos, an Application Developer at AEGIS Insurance. By day, Iâ€™m deeply immersed in building powerful solutions using technologies like .NET Framework, .NET Core, and ServiceNow. By night, Iâ€™m an artist and competitive Magic: The Gathering player, constantly brewing new decks when Iâ€™m not coding.

## ðŸ‘€ Interests
- Iâ€™m passionate about modernizing legacy systems with new technologies. My day-to-day work involves:
  - **.NET Framework & .NET Core**: Crafting web applications that deliver reliable and scalable business solutions.
  - **ServiceNow ITSM, ITOM, HAM, SAM**: Managing tickets, changes, and custom solutions for a better IT experience.
  - **Front-End Development**: Leveraging **Angular** and **React** to modernize outdated apps and improve the user experience.

## ðŸŒ± Learning & Development
- Currently diving into **Carbon** (a potential C++ replacement) to keep up with the latest trends in low-level programming.
- Pursuing **ServiceNow certifications** to further solidify my skills in IT service management and automation.

## âš¡ Fun Fact
- When Iâ€™m not coding or building solutions for AEGIS, Iâ€™m probably at a Magic: The Gathering tournament, competing with some of the best players!
